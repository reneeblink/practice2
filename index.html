                    <p><b>Cryptography</b> is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. This is what helps us authorize on a website or use an electronic signature for documents. That is, thanks to cryptography, our personal data is protected from possible theft and can participate in the secure transmission of information on the Internet.

                        Even if you have not been exposed to the concept of cryptography before, you are already familiar with how it works. It's the basis of bank transactions, Internet traffic, and even communication for your smartphone. It turns out that cryptography guarantees privacy, but how does it do that? </p>

            <h1>Sphere Of Usage</h1>
            <p>
                Modern cryptography is now used everywhere, because information technology and all sorts of gadgets are firmly embedded in various areas of human activity.

Here is where cryptography is most actively used:
            </p>

            <li> in banking (to transfer data between cards and accounts); </li>
            <br>
            <li>  in websites where there is authentication (to process and "remember" passwords on the network);</li>
            <br>
            <li>  in accounting (to send documents remotely);</li>
            <br>
            <li>  for information security (to prevent malefactors from getting hold of valuable data);</li>
            <br>
            <li>  in Internet sales to protect information transmitted openly (phone numbers, bank, regular and electronic addresses, etc.). </li>
            <br>

            <h4> It turns out that everywhere we talk about information and digital technology, there is a place for cryptography. So, as a profession, this direction is very promising.

                Cryptography is actively used in programming, computer science, information security, especially if we are talking about large projects. No matter what you are working on (whether it is a new application, a messenger or a server), there is always a risk of data interception. Cryptography helps to prevent leaks, there is a specific protection protocol for each operation, so there is no chance for fraudsters to get hold of your information. </h4>

             <h1> Variation Of Methods </h1>
             <p> The existing methods of cryptography are classified in different ways, but most often by the number of keys used.
                        From this point of view, a distinction is made: </p>
            <ol>
            <li> Keyless cryptographic methods (without the use of keys).</li>
            <br>
            <li> One-key methods (aka symmetric), which involve the use of a secret key.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Two-key (asymmetric methods). Here, in addition to the secret key, there is also a public key. </li>
            <br>
            </ol>

            <h1> Conclusion </h1>
            <p> The spread of the accessible Internet around the world is impossible to imagine without cryptography. With the advent of messengers, social networks, online stores and government service sites, the transfer of personal information online is happening nonstop and in huge quantities. Today we encounter cryptography every day when we enter a password from an email service, find out the status of an online purchase or make a money transfer through a bank application. Cryptography has come a long way from simple ancient ciphers to the most complex cryptosystems. The future of this science is happening right in front of our eyes - the next revolution in encryption will happen with the emergence of quantum supercomputers, which are already being developed. </p>
